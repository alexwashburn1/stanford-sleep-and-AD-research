# stanford-sleep-and-AD-research
Summer 2023 Internship research project with Joe Winer in the Mormino Lab. 
This project explores Actigraphy as a method of better understanding connections between sleep and neurodegenerative disease. <br>
Various directions are explored, including: 
1) Sleep metric comparisons across various packages (pyActigraphy (python), and GGIR and nPARACT (R))
2) Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep (LIDS) analysis, as put forward by Winnebeck et al. 2018
3) Day-to-day Modeling of objective and subjective sleep, and differences between healthy, Alzheimerâ€™s, and Lewy Body Subjects.
